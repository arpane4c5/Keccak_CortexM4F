# Keccak_CortexM4F

This repository contains the code for the implementation of SHA-3 hash function (KECCAK) for the CortexM4F micro controller. The target board used was TM4C123GXL by TI. Part of the code is taken from the lab exercises of EDX course on [Embedded Systems - Shape the World](https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.6.01x/1T2014/course/) by UTAustin which ran in March 2014.
